# JoltC
C wrapper for [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics).

## Other C Wrapper
Other C wrappers for Jolt Physics include:
- "JoltC", part of the [zphysics] Zig library started by [Michal Ziulek][michal-ziulek]
- "JoltC", part of the [jolt-rs] Rust library started by [cohaereo] and a fork of the zphysics C wrapper
- "joltc", part of the [JoltPhysicsSharp] C# library started by [Amer Koleci][amerkoleci]

The goal of this project is to be the first C wrapper around Jolt Physics that is not part of a larger binding project. It's intended to be useful for any other language-specific bindings and to reduce the need to duplicate work.
